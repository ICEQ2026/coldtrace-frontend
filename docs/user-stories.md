I want to create an account linked to an organization,  
so that I can start using ColdTrace as the first administrator of that organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: Visitor registers valid organization and account data**
  - **Given** the visitor completes the sign-up form with valid organization and access data,
  - **When** the visitor submits the account creation request,
  - **Then** the application creates the organization and the founder user with administrative access.

- **Scenario: Visitor uses an email that already exists**
  - **Given** another user already exists with the same email,
  - **When** the visitor submits the sign-up form,
  - **Then** the application rejects the request and shows that the account already exists.

### US008: Representing Account Verification

As a registered user,  
I want the application to represent my account as enabled after registration,  
so that the frontend delivery can continue without real email delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: Account is created in the frontend scope**
  - **Given** the account was created correctly,
  - **When** the registration flow finishes,
  - **Then** the account is treated as available for sign in.

### US009: Signing In

As a registered user,  
I want to sign in with my email and demo password,  
so that I can access the dashboard with my organization, role, and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User signs in with valid demo credentials**
  - **Given** the user exists in the local data source,
  - **When** the user enters valid credentials,
  - **Then** the application loads the user, organization, role, and dashboard access.

- **Scenario: User enters invalid credentials**
  - **Given** the email or password is incorrect,
  - **When** the user attempts to sign in,
  - **Then** the application blocks access and displays an error message.

### US010: Recovering a Password

As a registered user,  
I want to request password recovery,  
so that I can validate the reset experience without a real email backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User requests recovery with a registered email**
  - **Given** the email exists in the local users collection,
  - **When** the user submits the recovery request,
  - **Then** the application shows the simulated recovery confirmation.

- **Scenario: User requests recovery with an unknown email**
  - **Given** the email is not registered,
  - **When** the user submits the recovery request,
  - **Then** the application informs that the account cannot be found.

### US011: Managing Roles and Permissions

As an organization administrator,  
I want to manage users, roles, and permissions,  
so that each person can access the actions that match their operational responsibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: Administrator creates or updates an internal user**
  - **Given** the current user has access management permissions,
  - **When** the user creates an internal account or updates a role,
  - **Then** the application keeps that user within the active organization.

- **Scenario: Non-administrator opens the access module**
  - **Given** the current user does not have management permissions,
  - **When** the user opens the access screens,
  - **Then** the application keeps the information in read-only mode or restricts the action.

## Asset Management

### US012-US017: Managing Assets, Devices, and Gateways

As an operations user,  
I want to register assets, link IoT devices, pair gateways, and track calibration and connectivity,  
so that the monitoring infrastructure is organized and ready for operational control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User registers a cold room or refrigerated transport unit**
  - **Given** the user has asset management permissions,
  - **When** the user enters valid asset information,
  - **Then** the application stores the asset and shows it in the asset list.

- **Scenario: User links an IoT device to an asset**
  - **Given** an asset and an available device exist,
  - **When** the user links them,
  - **Then** the asset becomes available for monitoring.

- **Scenario: User reviews calibration and connectivity**
  - **Given** assets, devices, and gateways exist in the organization,
  - **When** the user opens the assets module,
  - **Then** the application shows calibration, connectivity, and operational state indicators.

## Monitoring

### US018-US023: Monitoring Temperature, Humidity, Connectivity, and Offline Sync

As an operations user,  
I want to monitor current readings, detect out-of-range values, review connectivity, and synchronize pending readings,  
so that I can react to operational risks in the cold chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User opens the operational dashboard**
  - **Given** assets and readings exist for the active organization,
  - **When** the user opens the dashboard,
  - **Then** the application shows KPIs, temperature trends, storage distribution, recent alerts, and maintenance information.

- **Scenario: A reading is out of range**
  - **Given** a sensor reading exceeds the configured safety range,
  - **When** the dashboard evaluates readings,
  - **Then** the application marks the reading as an alert or risk indicator.

- **Scenario: Pending offline readings exist**
  - **Given** readings are marked as pending synchronization,
  - **When** the user triggers sync,
  - **Then** the application changes their state to synced in the frontend store.

## Reports and Audit Evidence

### US029: Generating a Daily Log

As a quality or operations user,  
I want to generate a daily log by date and asset,  
so that I can review expected readings, registered readings, missing readings, and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User selects a day with available readings**
  - **Given** readings exist for the selected day,
  - **When** the user opens the daily log,
  - **Then** the application groups readings by asset and shows completeness and status.

### US030: Consulting Operational History

As a quality user,  
I want to review readings, alerts, and incidents by period and event type,  
so that I can reconstruct operational behavior over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User filters event history**
  - **Given** readings, alert events, or incident events exist,
  - **When** the user filters by period, asset, and event type,
  - **Then** the application shows a chronological event list and summary metrics.

### US031-US032: Exporting Compliance and Monthly Reports

As an administrative user,  
I want to export compliance and monthly reports,  
so that I can download evidence for review or audit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User downloads a report**
  - **Given** the selected period has data,
  - **When** the user triggers the export,
  - **Then** the application downloads a CSV file named with the organization and selected period.

### US033-US034: Reviewing Findings and Audit Evidence

As a quality user,  
I want to detect missing records, close findings, and prepare audit evidence,  
so that the organization can respond to internal or external reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: User reviews findings**
  - **Given** missing readings, open incidents, or compliance limitations exist,
  - **When** the user opens the findings module,
  - **Then** the application shows the finding severity, status, and affected asset.

- **Scenario: User prepares audit evidence**
  - **Given** monitoring data and report records exist,
  - **When** the user filters evidence by period and asset,
  - **Then** the application builds a checklist and allows CSV export.
